## Running the Project

### Using a Live Server Extension

1. If you haven't already, install a live server extension for your code editor. Some popular choices include:
   - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code
   - [Live Server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-server-web-extension/fiegdmejfepffgpnejdinekhfieaogmj) for Chrome

2. Once the extension is installed, navigate to the root directory of the project in your code editor.

3. Find the `index.html` file and right-click on it.

4. Select the option to "Open with Live Server" or a similar option provided by your extension.

5. Your default web browser should automatically open, displaying the Conway's Game of Life project.
