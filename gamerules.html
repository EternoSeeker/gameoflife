      <h1>How To Play?</h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Conway's Game of Life, or simply "Life," is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
        It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. Players interact with 
        the game by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. The game is Turing complete and can simulate a 
        universal constructor or any other Turing machine.</p>
    </div>
      <hr />
      <h2>The Universe</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
        Each cell is in one of two possible states, ALIVE or DEAD.
        Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</p>
    </div>
      <hr />
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <div class="card">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by
          underpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
          overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first generation is created by applying the above rules
        simultaneously to every cell in the seed, alive or dead; births and
        deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this
        happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function
        of the preceding one.
      </p>

      <div class="card-container">
        <div class="card">
        <h3>Glider</h3>
        <p>
          The glider is the smallest, most common, and first-discovered
          spaceship in Game of Life. It travels diagonally across the grid.
          Gliders are important because they are easily produced (by glider guns
          and rakes), can be collided with each other to form more complicated
          patterns, and can be used to transmit information over long distances.

        <div class="card"> 
        <h3>Big Glider</h3>
        <p>
          The big glider was found by Dean Hickerson in December 1989 and was
          the first known diagonal spaceship other than the glider. Two gliders
          can be temporarily seen at the front of the ship; these do not stay
          gliders but still move like them.

        <h3>Gosper Glider Gun</h3>
        <p>
          The Gosper glider gun is the first known gun, and indeed the first
          known finite pattern with unbounded growth, found by Bill Gosper in
          November 1970. It consists of two queen bee shuttles stabilized by two
          blocks.

        <h3>Pulsar</h3>
        <p>
          The pulsar is a period-3 oscillator, meaning it returns to its initial state after three generations. It’s a symmetric pattern and one of the most recognized oscillators in the Game of Life.

          This term isn’t standard in the Game of Life nomenclature but could refer to a specific type of oscillator or a similar repeating pattern that creates a visual effect resembling a circle of fire.

          The quadpole is the eighth most common oscillator in Achim Flammenkamp's census, being less common than the bipole but more common than the great on-off. It is the eighth most common oscillator on Adam P. Goucher's Catagolue.

          Spider is a c/5 orthogonal spaceship that was discovered by David Bell on April 14, 1997. It is the smallest known c/5 orthogonal spaceship. Its side sparks have proven to be very useful in constructing puffers and rakes.

        <h3>Spaceship</h3>
        <p>
          The middleweight spaceship (commonly abbreviated to MWSS) or (rarely) medium fish is the third most common spaceship after the glider and lightweight spaceship. 
          It was found by John Conway in 1970 and travels at c/2 orthogonally.
          It can support various non-standard components, such as pushalong 1.

          Boat-tie is the twentieth most common still life on Adam P. Goucher's Catagolue, being less common than shillelagh but more common than snake.
          It is also the twenty-seventh most common object overall on Catagolue.
          Two copies of boat-tie can be seen in a symmetric constellation that evolves from two traffic light predecessors.

          The Pentadecathlon is a period-15 oscillator that was found in 1970 by John Conway. 
          It is one of the most well-known patterns in the Game of Life, notable for its longevity and distinctive structure. 
          It is composed of 10 cells in a row that form a stable pattern with a period of 15 generations, 
          making it a popular subject of study and demonstration in the Game of Life.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div class="card">
      <p>
        Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating exploration of life, death, and
        the rules that govern them. Despite its simplicity, it can lead to
        complex and beautiful patterns. Game of Life offers a unique way to
        explore the unpredictable beauty of life itself.
